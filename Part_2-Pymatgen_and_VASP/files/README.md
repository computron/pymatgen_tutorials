# Test files for pymatgen tutorial

Notes:

1. Test files are a modified version of those found in the atomate2 repo; hence the atomate2 license is copied here.
2. Note that some output files are removed for conciseness, these are not always intended to be complete.
3. Note that POTCAR files in particular are cleaned up due to VASP license terms.
